- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Spring Security
- RestTemplate
- JUnit and Mockito
- Swagger for API documentation (optional)

## API Endpoints

For detailed API endpoints, please refer to the [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/avionics-astronaut-49946802/workspace/highway-ticket-system-api-end-points/collection/30946779-d7009ce6-31ec-44c1-83eb-15996fcda8c2?action=share&creator=30946779).

## Entities

### Task

- **id**: Long
- **title**: String
- **description**: String
- **priority**: Enum (low, medium, high)
- **status**: Enum (to-do, in-progress, completed)
- **dueDate**: LocalDate
- **assignedUser**: User

### User

- **id**: Long
- **username**: String
- **email**: String
- **role**: Enum (admin, user)

## Features

1. CRUD operations for Task and User entities.
2. Assign tasks to users, with users only able to view their own tasks.
3. Filter tasks by status, priority, and due date.
4. Implement role-based access control:
   - Admins can create, update, and delete users and tasks.
   - Regular users can view, update, and delete tasks assigned to them.
5. Implement pagination and sorting for task lists.
6. External API Integration with RestTemplate:
   - Fetch task details from an external API (e.g., a bug tracker or task-related service).
   - Validate assigned users via an external API call.
   - Log external API responses and handle errors.

## Technical Aspects

- Use DTOs for request and response objects.
- Implement a Service Layer for business logic.
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations with MySQL.
- Implement role-based security with Spring Security.
- Handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
- Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd task-management-system
   ```
   
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

4. Set up your MySQL database and update the `application.properties` with your database configurations.

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Extras

1. JWT-based authentication for securing the API (optional).
2. API documentation with Swagger (optional).
3. Email notifications for overdue tasks (not implemented).
4. Implement Circuit Breaker (using Resilience4j) to handle API failures (not implemented).

## Future Work

- Implement email notifications for overdue tasks.
- Implement Circuit Breaker to handle external API failures gracefully.
- External API Integration with RestTemplate:
   - Fetch task details from an external API (e.g., a bug tracker or task-related service).
   - Validate assigned users via an external API call.
   - Log external API responses and handle errors.
